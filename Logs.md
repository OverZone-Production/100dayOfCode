## Day 3 - April 20, 2022 

**Today's Progress:** - Error

**Thoughts:** - after finish setting up the player and camera I set up the enemy but then found: 

"InvalidOperationException: You are trying to read Input using the UnityEngine.Input class, but you have switched active Input handling to Input System package in Player Settings.
UnityEngine.Input.get_mousePosition () (at <963c3a1707f0469aac8b8356a8d18b5d>:0)
TheRPG.Controller.PlayerController.GetMouseRay () (at Assets/Game/Script/Controller/PlayerController.cs:55)
TheRPG.Controller.PlayerController.InteractWithCombat () (at Assets/Game/Script/Controller/PlayerController.cs:19)

TheRPG.Core.FollowCamera.LateUpdate () (at Assets/Game/Script/Core/FollowCamera.cs:21)" error

I don't really know what I mess up so I will create a new project and redo all my work but right now I so pissed off
